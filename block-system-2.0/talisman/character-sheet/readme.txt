Rolls are 3d6, third die is the Kismet die.

Looks like this on the die roller:
roll 2d6, add 1d6 with special conditions:
	cf=1 --> critical fail, shown as 1__
	cs=6 --> critical success, shown as 6**

Kismet die = 1 --> 1 dark fate for the GM

	You rolled:2d6+1d6cf=1cs=6: [4, 6]+[1__] = 11

Kismet die = 6 --> 1 light fate for the player

	You rolled:2d6+1d6cf=1cs=6: [2, 2]+[6**] = 10
